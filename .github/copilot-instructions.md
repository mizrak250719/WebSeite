# Copilot Instructions for WebSeite

## Project Overview
This is a simple personal website project, primarily consisting of a single HTML file (`index.html`). The site presents personal information, hobbies, and contact details in German. There are no build tools, frameworks, or external dependencies detected.

## Architecture & Structure
- **Single-page HTML**: All content and styling are contained in `index.html`.
- **Styling**: CSS is embedded within a `<style>` block in the HTML `<head>`. No external CSS files or preprocessors are used.
- **No JavaScript**: There is currently no client-side scripting.
- **No backend**: The project is static and does not interact with any server or API.
- **Directory**: The `meineWebSeite` folder is present but currently empty.

## Developer Workflows
- **Editing**: Directly modify `index.html` for all content and style changes.
- **Previewing**: Open `index.html` in a browser to view changes. No build or test steps are required.
- **Localization**: All content is in German; maintain this language for consistency.

## Project-Specific Conventions
- **Design**: Uses a blue color scheme (`#4a90e2`) for headers and footer.
- **Content Sections**: Organized into `Ãœber mich`, `Meine Hobbys`, and `Kontakt` sections using semantic HTML (`<section>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).
- **Accessibility**: Basic semantic HTML is used, but no ARIA attributes or advanced accessibility features are present.

## Patterns & Examples
- **Add new sections**: Use `<section>` tags within `<main>`, following the existing style and structure.
- **Update styles**: Edit the `<style>` block in `index.html`.
- **Contact links**: Use `<a href="mailto:...">` for email addresses.

## Recommendations for AI Agents
- Keep all content in German.
- Maintain the clean, minimal design and semantic HTML structure.
- If expanding, place new pages or assets in the `meineWebSeite` folder and update navigation accordingly.
- Avoid introducing frameworks or build tools unless explicitly requested.

## Key Files
- `index.html`: Main site content and styles.
- `meineWebSeite/`: Reserved for future expansion; currently empty.
